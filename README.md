# [tippfehlr’s AUR packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=tippfehlr&SeB=m)

These are all the packages that I maintain (or co-maintain, though there are none right now).

This repository uses [aurpublish](https://github.com/eli-schwartz/aurpublish).

[nvchecker](https://github.com/lilydjwg/nvchecker) is set up to check for new releases via GitHub Actions. \
Every day at 02:00, the workflow runs nvchecker and creates a pull request if a new version is found. \
The PR gets updated if it’s not closed on the next run. \
Have a look at the [workflow](./github/workflows/nvchecker.yaml) if you’re interested.
